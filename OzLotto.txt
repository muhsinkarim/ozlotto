otherwise they sit on the fence like me. As I sit here comfortably on the fence, I’d like to reflect on why one would choose one tool over the other based on my own experience and that on my friends and colleagues. Not so-much pros and cons of the tool’s features, but the practical circumstances that nudge or pigeon-hole the nascent data scientist into a first choice.  

Choices, choices – Are you selecting R or Python for your data science scripting tool of choice at work? The answer as always is, it depends. It depends on where you’re coming from (statistics, academia, computer science or engineering for example). It depends on what your colleagues are currently using. It also depends on the first few online programming courses you enrolled in.

It’s not just a choice between R or Python. Another is between data visualisation tools Tableau and Power BI. Tableau is the industry lead and has been for years. It’s been part of the data scientists’ toolkit for years, yet Power Bi is picking-up steam. 

That’s an unfortunate situation to be in – being able to wrangling and analyse the you work with is an ideal scenario to be in. Not only do you apply your data science skills on the job, but you have the opportunity to build something useful and get buy-in for your approach.
